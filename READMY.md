TrackmanIA

Description

TrackmanIA is an artificial intelligence project based on Q-Learning, using PyTorch and Pygame to train an autonomous car to navigate in an environment defined by a map.

Features

Use of PyTorch for the deep Q-learning model.

Simulation of a car in a graphical environment with Pygame.

Implementation of a reinforcement learning algorithm.

Loading of custom maps for training.

Installation

Prerequisites

Make sure you have installed Python 3.x and the necessary libraries:
pip install numpy pygame torch

Usage

Run the main script to start training:

python3 trackmanIA.py
or
with the jupyter file

You can modify the hyperparameters in the configuration file or directly in the script.
